# Portfolio Website

This portfolio website is built using modern web technologies including React, Vite, Framer Motion for smooth animations, and Tailwind CSS for styling. It offers a minimalistic setup with hot module replacement (HMR) to speed up development.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **Framer Motion**: A popular library for animations in React projects.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

## Installation

Before installing, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed (preferably the latest LTS version).

1. Clone the repository:
```   
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourportfolio.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```   
cd yourportfolio
```
3. Install dependencies:
```   
npm install
```
## Running the Project

To run the project locally:

1. Start the development server:
```   
npm run dev
```
This command will start the local server using Vite, which typically runs on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). The site will automatically reload if you make changes to the source files.

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

1. Build the project:
```   
npm run build
```

Vite builds your project for production and outputs the files to the `dist/` directory.

2. Preview the production build:
```   
npm run preview
```
This serves the production build on a local static server.
